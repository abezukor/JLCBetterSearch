# Archived for [better tool](https://github.com/yaqwsx/jlcparts)
[Another search tool](https://github.com/yaqwsx/jlcparts) has been published that has more features and is being updated. This repository is therefore being archived.
# Original README

The [JLCPCB SMT search tool](https://jlcpcb.com/parts) is lacking so I made a better one using there downloadable parts library. Note that I do not update the parts library often so the in-stock numbers **will** be incorrect.

Thie site is live at [jlcbettersearch.abezukor.com](http://jlcbettersearch.abezukor.com/)
